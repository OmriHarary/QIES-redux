A reimplementation of Queen's Computing CISC 327 Fall 2018 course project for fun and practice

## Introduction
Queen's University School of Computing Software Quality Assurance (CISC 327) Fall 2018 course assignment was the implementation of a two-part software system according to an intentionally obtuse specification. After initially completing this project in Java for the course, here I am going to reimplement it in C# as an opportunity for practice.

## Goals
1. Practice C# development, testing, and project archetecture with a project that includes some amount of complexity.
2. Apply learnings since the original design and implementation of the project to improve upon it.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Reimplement original Java design in C#
  - [x] Reimplement "frontend"
  - [ ] Reimplement "backoffice"
- [ ] Enhance original test suite with actual unit tests
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] ...
